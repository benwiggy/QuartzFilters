# QuartzFilters

This is a collection of Quartz ColorSync Filters for MacOS. While filters work well at manipulating, converting or altering images and PDF documents, the OS-bundled app to create them, ColorSync Utility, is profoundly broken and can corrupt filters.

Put these files in {user}/Library/Filters. Another location is /Library/Filters. They will then be available to apps like Preview, and you can use them in conjunction with the scripts and workflows in PDFSuite to produce other ways of applying them to PDFs.
